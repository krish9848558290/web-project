<p>The <strong>The Ford Mustang is a line of sporty coupes and convertibles that was first introduced in 1964. The Mustang's long hood and short deck design made it a popular choice and helped create the "pony car" automobile segment. <strong></strong></p>
<div><br>The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973.</strong><br>
    <br> The introduction of the Mustang created a new class of automobiles known as pony cars. The Mustang's styling, with its long hood and short deck, proved wildly popular and inspired a host of competition.<br>

  <br>  It was introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and convertible, with the fastback version following in August 1964. 
    Upon introduction, the Mustang, sharing its platform with the Falcon, was slotted into the compact car segment.<br>
    
   <br> The first-generation Mustangs grew in overall dimensions and engine power with each revision. The 1971 model featured a drastic redesign. After an initial surge, sales steadily declined, and Ford began working on a new generation Mustang. With the onset of the 1973 oil crisis, Ford was prepared, having already designed the smaller Mustang II for the 1974 model years
    . This new car shared no components with preceding models.<br>
